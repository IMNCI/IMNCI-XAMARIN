                        In Kenya, 52 out of every 1000 children born do not live to be five years of age (KDHS 2014). 70% of all deaths in children can be attributed to easily preventable and treatable diseases namely: Acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), Diarrhoea, Measles, Malaria, Malnutrition and Anaemia and HIV. Often, children succumb to a combination of these conditions - with children presenting in health facilities with the combined signs and symptoms of more than one of these diseases. Evidence from various assessments has shown that many of these children are not comprehensively assessed, treated and given the appropriate advice. Recognizing the need to improve on the care of these children, WHO and UNICEF developed the Integrated Management of Childhood illness (IMCI) strategy which emphasizes on integrated case management of most common childhood diseases.Kenya in the year 2000 adopted the IMCI strategy which forms a critical part of the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH).

                        The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) case management approach offers simple and effective methods to comprehensively prevent and manage the leading causes of serious illness and mortality in children below five years. With IMCI, sick children are not only treated for the signs and symptoms they present with in a health facility, but are also assessed for the other disease conditions they may be suffering from.\nIMCI is based on the following principles:

                            Children and infants are then assessed for main symptoms. For the older children, the symptoms included cough or difficulty breathing, diarrhoea, fever, HIV, ear infections, anaemia, measles and malnutrition.

                            Essential drugs are then used to treat the children. Lastly, counseling of caregivers regarding home care, appropriate feeding and fluids and when to return to facility- immediately or for follow up, is done.

                            All sick children aged upto to five years of age are examined for general danger signs and all young infants are examined for signs of very severe disease. These signs indicate the need for immediate referral or admission to hospital.
